/**
 * Many java developers wrote methods to calculate a factorial value using a
 * recursive or iterative algorithm. It's time to do it with streams.
 * <p>
 * The factorial of n is calculated by the product of integer number from 1 to n (inclusive).
 * The factorial of 0 is equal to 1.
 * <p>
 * Important. Use the given template for your factorial method.
 * Pay attention to type of an argument and the returned value. Please, don't use cycles or recursion.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input 1:
 * 0
 * <p>
 * Sample Output 1:
 * 1
 * <p>
 * Sample Input 2:
 * 1
 * <p>
 * Sample Output 2:
 * 1
 * <p>
 * Sample Input 3:
 * 2
 * <p>
 * Sample Output 3:
 * 2
